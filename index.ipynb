    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "1. Null\n",
    "2. Interger\n",
    "3. Text\n",
    "4. Blob\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes we can use common sql datatypes such as VARCHAR, CHAR, BOOLEAN, DATE TIME\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "Their relationship ensures referential integrity. We can't have a foreign key value that does not exist as a primary key in the referenced table.\n",
    "\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "1. One-to-One: Each record in Table A relates to exactly one record in Table B\n",
    "2. One-to-Many: A record in Table A can relate to multiple records in Table B, but each record in Table B relates to only one record in      Table A \n",
    "3. Many-to-Many: multiple entries for the shared field in both tables\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "1. Inner Join: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables\n",
    "2. Left Outer Join : Returns all rows from the left table, plus matching rows from the right table\n",
    "3. Right Outer Join: Returns all rows from the right table, plus matching rows from the left table\n",
    "4. Full Outer Join : Returns rows when there is a match in either table.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "Without GROUP BY an Aggregate function treats the entire result set as one group. With GROUP BY the entire aggregate is calculated separately for each group\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "In a many-to-many relationship, associative entities act as linkages between two main tables.\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
